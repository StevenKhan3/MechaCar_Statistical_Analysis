## Study Design: MechaCar vs Competition
A statistical analysis of criteria that maximize customer utility can be done to estimate how "MechaCar" may fare in comparison to the competitors. Utility in economics refers to how much use or pleasure a consumer can derive from consuming a good or service. The metrics in this research that could impact a vehicle's utility include:
- Purchase Price
- Fuel Efficiency (Highway and City)
- Maintenance Cost
- Safety Ratings
- Horsepower
- Storage Capacity

The null hypothesis and alternative hypothesis for this proposed study are as follows:  
MechaCar would have high consumer utility and would perform well against competitors.  
MechaCar would *not* have high consumer utility and would *not* perform well against competitors. 

Multiple Linear Regressions would be performed to find the statistically significant variables that influence sales of similar automobiles after obtaining the data required for the metrics given above. Through the analysis of variance test, the performance of MechaCar in four crucial categories will be compared to the mean performance of rivals.

It is advised to construct MechaCar if it is discovered that it would have a high level of consumer utility and would perform well when compared to rival vehicles. Otherwise, it is not advised to produce MechaCar if the null hypothesis is rejected.
